# WeatherApp

This project was generated with [Angular CLI](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli) version 1.3.2.

##Purpose
Purpose is to create a simple weather application using the open weather api using the angular 6 latest framework.
The project uses `HttpClientModule` , `Bootstrap 4` , `Geolocation browser service`.
It also uses observables for fetching the geolocation and handles errors nicely.


##Prerequisites
* Node 8.0 and greater
* Run `npm install` to install all the dependencies.
* Replace your open weather api key in app/config.js.




## Development server

Run `ng serve` for a dev server. Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The app will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.

## Code scaffolding

Run `ng generate component component-name` to generate a new component. You can also use `ng generate directive|pipe|service|class|guard|interface|enum|module`.

## Build

Run `ng build` to build the project. The build artifacts will be stored in the `dist/` directory. Use the `-prod` flag for a production build.

## Running unit tests

Run `ng test` to execute the unit tests via [Karma](https://karma-runner.github.io).

## Running end-to-end tests

Run `ng e2e` to execute the end-to-end tests via [Protractor](http://www.protractortest.org/).
Before running the tests make sure you are serving the app via `ng serve`.
